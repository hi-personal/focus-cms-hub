# Focus CMS – Community

## Core principles of the Focus CMS community:

- Not a performance-driven project: no pressure around deadlines or output.
- Built around real human values and practical needs.
- An open-source mindset, even while the project is still evolving.
- Creating a practical solution together and maintaining it collaboratively over the long term.
- Further technical direction and details are described in the Technical description document.
