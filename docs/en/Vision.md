# Focus CMS – Vision

## About me – briefly

- I have mostly developed my skills in the field of IT in a self-taught way.
- I have a strong affinity for Linux-based distributions.
- I have been programming as a hobby since childhood, with a full-stack mindset.
- My first computer was a Commodore 64, which we received as a gift from one of my father’s friends.
  Even back then, I was more interested in command-line interaction, and this is where I first experienced programming through BASIC.
- Programming languages and technologies I am familiar with to varying degrees:
  **PHP, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Alpine.js, CSS, Bash, QBasic**

## What motivated me to create my own CMS?

My path into programming followed a fairly classic route.
I was first introduced to HTML in vocational secondary school, and it fascinated me from the very beginning. Not only the language itself, but the “magic” of how a browser engine brings code to life.

*I would like to expand on this in a separate blog post later on.*

I initially started working with WordPress, followed by Joomla. As I gained more experience in using and customizing them, I experimented with many other CMS solutions as well—perhaps ten, twenty, or even more. The entire ecosystem was captivating.

Over time, I became familiar with dynamic behavior and PHP, which opened up completely new perspectives for me.
After creating custom WordPress themes, I gradually started developing smaller plugins as well, primarily for my own use.

However, after years of usage and experimentation, I kept returning to the same issues:
- recurring development frustrations,
- unavoidable compromises,
- structural limitations.

I made several attempts to build my own solutions, but at the time my knowledge and experience were still limited.
Fortunately, I encountered skilled and supportive developers who encouraged me along the way. Thanks to one of them, I truly understood object-oriented programming in PHP.

Those developers who would have been able to provide long-term mentorship for a custom CMS project understandably did not have sufficient free capacity.
As a result, my own solutions remained, for a long time, in the form of extensions and workarounds rather than a coherent system.

## What brought the breakthrough for me?

The breakthrough came with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).

AI provided a level of support that covered the entire process:
- planning,
- learning,
- implementation,
- problem solving.

With these “tireless assistants,” I began to explore the Laravel framework in greater depth and apply it in practice.

From that point on, Focus CMS was no longer a distant idea, but a realistically achievable goal.

## What goals did I have when creating Focus CMS?

First and foremost, I wanted to create a system for myself that:

- has minimal external dependencies,
- is transparent from both a development and operational perspective,
- remains stable in the long term.

I wanted to move away from the compromises commonly associated with WordPress and build a cleaner, more integrated solution.

My concept is a **monolithic system with a modular mindset**, where:
- core functionality is integrated,
- the system does not rely on a large number of plugins,
- themes primarily focus on template files.

My long-term goal is that, if the project becomes available in an open form,
all created functionality should be an integral part of the system,
and the direction of development should be shaped by the real needs of its users.

## Current state and future outlook

The current system, which I developed for my own use, is functional,
and based on several decades of experience, I believe it could also align well with the needs of others.

My intention is to bring it to a level where it can be safely released as an open project,
allowing others to benefit from the work invested so far.

To achieve this, I am looking for collaborators with deeper knowledge or greater experience than my own,
with whom a long-term, sustainable, community-driven project can gradually take shape around Focus CMS.
