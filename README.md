# Focus CMS HUB

"Focus CMS project overview and place to join the community"

---

Language: English | [Magyar](README.hu.md)

---

## What is this repository?

The **Focus CMS HUB** is the public, concise overview and connection point for my **Focus CMS** project, built on PHP and [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/starter-kits).

This repository **does not contain the CMS source code**.
Instead, it provides a short technical overview, the underlying ideas, and a place for community connection.

The project is currently in an **early stage**, and the core code is being developed in a **private repository**.

## What is the goal of Focus CMS?

Focus CMS is the practical realization of a long-standing idea of mine.

I am exploring a content management system that combines practical elements from several CMS solutions I have used and tested over the years, together with my own experience and ideas.

The main principles are:

- simple
- transparent
- not overloaded
- modern in approach
- primarily focused on real content

The goal is not to build a “do-everything” system, but a well-thought-out, clean foundation.

---

## Why this public HUB?

I created this repository to:

- share the core ideas and direction of the project,
- provide a brief overview for those interested in the concept,
- create a space for connection, discussion, and shared thinking.

If, over time, a small team and community form around it, the project may evolve into a **more open, community-driven** direction.

---

## Who am I looking for?

People who:

- are interested in designing content management systems,
- value collaboration and human connection,
- are open to an open-source mindset,
- or simply want to discuss ideas and share feedback.

This is a **voluntary, hobby-based initiative**, and active development is not an expectation.

---

## Current state of the project

- Core code: private repository
- Status: functional
- Currently, only my own website has been running on it for months:
  https://hatalaistvan.hu

This repository serves documentation and community purposes only; the Focus CMS source code is not part of this repository.
